            "expert": "<h1>Introduction to Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h1>\n\n<h2>What is 2FA?</h2>\n\n<p>2FA is an authentication method that uses two different factors to verify a user's identity. The first factor is typically something that the user knows, such as a password or PIN. The second factor is typically something that the user has, such as a smartphone or hardware token.</p>\n\n<p>When a user logs in to a website or service that uses 2FA, they will be prompted to enter their password. After entering their password, they will be prompted to enter a code that is sent to their smartphone or generated by a hardware token. This code is used to verify that the user is who they say they are.</p>\n          \n<h2>2FA Factors</h2>\n\n<p>There are three main types of 2FA factors:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Knowledge factors:</strong> Something that the user knows, such as a password, PIN, or security question.</li>\n<li><strong>Possession factors:</strong> Something that the user has, such as a smartphone, hardware token, or smart card.</li>\n<li><strong>Inherence factors:</strong> Something that the user is, such as a fingerprint, voice print, or iris scan.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Benefits of 2FA</h2>\n\n<p>2FA provides a number of benefits over traditional authentication methods, such as passwords. These benefits include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increased security:</strong> 2FA makes it much more difficult for attackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. This is because attackers would need to have both your password and your smartphone or hardware token in order to log in.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced risk of phishing:</strong> Phishing attacks are attempts to trick users into providing their passwords or other sensitive information. 2FA can help to protect against phishing attacks because it requires users to provide a second factor of authentication, which is not typically available to attackers.</li>\n<li><strong>Compliance with regulations:</strong> Some regulations, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), require businesses to use 2FA for certain types of transactions.</li>\n</ul>\n        \n<h2>How to Enable 2FA</h2>\n\n<p>Enabling 2FA is a simple process that can be completed in a few minutes. The specific steps will vary depending on the website or service that you are using. However, the general steps are as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the security settings for the website or service that you want to enable 2FA for.</li>\n<li>Find the option to enable 2FA.</li>\n<li>Follow the instructions to set up 2FA.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Once you have enabled 2FA, you will be prompted to enter a code from your smartphone or hardware token whenever you log in. This code will help to verify that you are who you say you are and protect your account from unauthorized access.</p>",

When you enable 2FA, you're required to provide two different pieces of information when you log in, instead of just one (e.g., your password). This makes it much more difficult for attackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password.</p>\n\n<h2>How does 2FA work?</h2>\n\n<p>2FA typically works by sending you a code via SMS or email, or by generating a code through an app on your phone. When you log in to an account with 2FA enabled, you'll be prompted to enter your password as usual. You'll then be asked to enter the code that was sent to your phone or generated by the app.</p>\n\n<h2>2FA Factors</h2>\n\n<p>2FA factors are the different types of information that you can use to authenticate your identity. The most common 2FA factors are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Something you know:</strong> This could be your password, a PIN, or a security question.</li>\n<li><strong>Something you have:</strong> This could be your phone, a token, or a smart card.</li>\n<li><strong>Something you are:</strong> This could be your fingerprint, your voice, or your facial recognition.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The strongest 2FA methods use a combination of two or more factors. For example, you could use your password (something you know) and your phone (something you have) to authenticate your identity.</p>\n\n<h2>Benefits of 2FA</h2>\n\n<p>2FA offers a number of benefits, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increased security:</strong> 2FA makes it much more difficult for attackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduced risk of phishing attacks:</strong> Phishing attacks attempt to trick you into giving up your password or other sensitive information. 2FA can help to protect you from these attacks by requiring you to provide a second factor of authentication.</li>\n<li><strong>Peace of mind:</strong> Knowing that your accounts are protected by 2FA can give you peace of mind.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to enable 2FA</h2>\n\n<p>Enabling 2FA typically involves the following steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Visit the website or app that you want to enable 2FA for.</li>\n<li>Go to the settings page and look for the 2FA section.</li>\n<li>Follow the instructions to enable 2FA.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>2FA is an important security measure that can help to protect your online accounts from unauthorized access.

These messages are designed to manipulate the recipient into performing an action, such as installing malware, clicking a malicious link or divulging sensitive information like access credentials.</p>\n\n<p>Phishing attacks can take many forms, but the most common methods are email, text message (smishing) or phone call (vishing).</p>\n\n<h2>How to Spot a Phishing Attack</h2>\n\n<p>There are several things you can look for to help you spot a phishing attack:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>The sender's email address or phone number does not match the organization they claim to represent.</em></li>\n<li><em>The message contains typos or grammatical errors.</em></li>\n<li><em>The message creates a sense of urgency or panic.</em></li>\n<li><em>The message asks you to click on a link or open an attachment.</em></li>\n<li><em>The message asks you to provide personal information, such as your password or credit card number.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>What to Do If You Receive a Phishing Attack</h2>\n\n<p>If you receive an email or text message that you believe may be a phishing attack, do not click on any links or open any attachments. Instead, forward the message to your security team or delete it.</p>\n\n<p>If you have already clicked on a link or opened an attachment, you should immediately change your passwords and contact your security team.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Avoid Phishing Attacks</h2>\n\n<p>There are several things you can do to help avoid phishing attacks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Be wary of emails or text messages from unknown senders.</em></li>\n<li><em>Do not click on links or open attachments in emails or text messages from unknown senders.</em></li>\n<li><em>Be cautious of emails or text messages that create a sense of urgency or panic.</em></li>\n<li><em>Never provide personal information, such as your password or credit card number, in response to an email or text message.</em></li>\n<li><em>Use a strong password for your email account and other online accounts.</em></li>\n<li><em>Enable two-factor authentication for your email account and other online accounts.</em></li>\n<li><em>Keep your software up to date.</em></li>\n<li><em>Use a firewall and anti-virus software.</em></li>\n<li><em>Educate yourself about phishing attacks.</em></li>\n</ul>",
            "expert": "<h1>Introduction to Phishing</h1>\n\n<p>Phishing is a type of cyberattack that uses deceptive emails, text messages, or phone calls to trick victims into providing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or social security numbers. Phishing attacks often look like they come from legitimate sources, such as banks, credit card companies, or government agencies. However, they are actually sent by cybercriminals who are trying to steal your information.</p>\n\n<h2>What is Phishing?</h2>\n\n<p>Phishing attacks are typically carried out through email or instant message, and attackers pose as legitimate representatives of organizations to gain this information, which is then used to access accounts or systems. Ultimately, once in the hands of adversaries, it often leads to identity theft or significant financial loss.</p>\n\n<h3>How Does Phishing Work?</h3>\n\n<p>Phishing attacks rely on social engineering techniques to trick victims into taking actions that they would not normally take. Cybercriminals send an email or text message that appears to come from a legitimate source, and they include a link to a website that looks like the real thing. When the victim clicks on the link, they are taken to a fake website that collects their personal information.</p>\n\n<h3>What are the Different Types of Phishing Attacks?</h3>\n\n<p>There are many different types of phishing attacks, but some of the most common include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Email phishing:</strong> This is the most common type of phishing attack. Phishing emails typically contain a link to a fake website or a request for sensitive information.</li>\n  <li><strong>Spear phishing:</strong> This is a more targeted type of phishing attack that is directed at specific individuals or organizations. Spear phishing emails are often personalized and appear to come from a trusted source, such as a friend or colleague.</li>\n  <li><strong>Whaling:</strong> This is a type of phishing attack that targets high-level executives. Whaling emails are often very sophisticated and can be difficult to detect.</li>\n  <li><strong>Smishing:</strong> This is a type of phishing attack that uses text messages. Smishing messages typically contain a link to a fake website or a request for sensitive information.</li>\n  <li><strong>Vishing:</strong> This is a type of phishing attack that uses phone calls. Vishing attacks often use automated messages to trick users into providing sensitive information.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Avoid Phishing Attacks</h2>\n\n<p>There are a number of things you can do to avoid phishing attacks, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Be suspicious of emails or text messages that you receive from unknown senders. If you are not expecting an email or text message from a particular sender, be wary of clicking on any links or opening any attachments.</li>\n<li>Hover over links before clicking on them. This will show you the actual URL of the website that you are about to visit. If the URL looks suspicious, do not click on the link.</li>\n<li>Look for misspellings and grammatical errors. Phishing emails and text messages often contain misspellings and grammatical errors. This is because they are often written by non-native English speakers.</li>\n<li>Be careful about what information you share online. Never share your personal information, such as your password, credit card number, or social security number, with anyone you do not know.</li>\n<li>Use a strong password. Your password should be at least 12 characters long and contain a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols.</li>\n<li>Enable two-factor authentication. Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. When you log in to an account, you will be asked to enter your password and a code that is sent to your phone.</li>\n<li>Keep your software up to date. Software updates often include security patches that can help protect you from phishing attacks.</li>\n<li>Report phishing attacks to your email provider. If you receive a phishing email, report it to your email provider. This will help them to track down the cybercriminals and stop them from sending more phishing emails.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Phishing is a serious threat to your online security.

            "beginner": "<h1>On your path to improving your digital security</h1>\n<p>You may encounter bad actors who attempt to undermine your security goals. We call these bad actors adversaries. When an adversary sends an email or link that looks innocent, but is actually malicious it\u2019s called phishing.</p>\n<p>A phishing attack usually comes in the form of a message meant to convince you to:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>click on a link;</li>\n    <li>open a document;</li>\n    <li>install software on your device; or</li>\n    <li>enter your username and password into a website that\u2019s made to look legitimate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Phishing attacks can trick you into giving up your passwords or trick you into installing malware on your device. Attackers can use malware to remotely control your device, steal information, or spy on you.</p>\n<p>This guide will help you to identify phishing attacks when you see them and outline some practical ways to help defend against them.</p>\n<h2>Types of Phishing Attacks</h2>\n<h3>Phishing for Passwords (aka Credential Harvesting)</h3>\n<p>Phishers can trick you into giving them your passwords by sending you a deceptive link. Web addresses in a message may appear to have one destination, but lead to another. On your computer, you can usually see the destination URL by hovering over the link. But links can be further disguised with lookalike letters, or by using domain names that are one letter off from legitimate domain names and may direct you to a webpage that appears to go to a service that you use, such as Gmail or Dropbox. These fake replica login screens often look so legitimate that it\u2019s tempting to type your username and password.

Keeping your software up to date reduces malware risks.</p>\n<p>Use a password manager with auto-fill</p>\n<p>Password managers that auto-fill passwords keep track of which sites those passwords belong to. While it\u2019s easy for a human to be tricked by fake login pages, password managers are not tricked in the same way. If you use a password manager (including the built-in password manager in your browser), and it refuses to auto-fill a password, you should hesitate and double check the site you\u2019re on. Better yet, use randomly generated passwords so that you are forced to rely on auto-fill, and less likely to type your password into a fake login page.</p>\n<p>Verify Emails with Senders</p>\n<p>One way to determine if an email is a phishing attack is to check via a different channel with the person who supposedly sent it. If the email was purportedly sent from your bank, don\u2019t click on links in the email. Instead, call your bank or open your browser and type in the URL of your bank's website. Likewise, if your Uncle Boris sends you an email attachment, call him on the phone and ask if he sent you pictures of his kids before opening it.</p>\n",

            "beginner": "<h1>Introduction to Password Security</h1>\n\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n<p>Password security is the practice of creating and using strong passwords to protect your online accounts. A password is a secret word or phrase that is used to verify your identity when you log in to a website or app. A strong password is one that is difficult to guess or crack.</p>\n\n<h2>Importance of Strong Passwords</h2>\n\n<p>Using strong passwords is important because it helps to protect your online accounts from being hacked. Hackers can use a variety of methods to try to guess or crack your passwords, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Brute force attacks:</strong> Hackers use a computer program to try every possible password until they find the correct one.</li>\n    <li><strong>Dictionary attacks:</strong> Hackers use a list of common words and phrases to try as passwords.</li>\n    <li><strong>Phishing attacks:</strong> Hackers create fake websites or emails that look like they are from legitimate companies, in an attempt to trick you into entering your password.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If a hacker is able to guess or crack your password, they will have access to your online accounts. This could allow them to steal your personal information, such as your name, address, and credit card number. They could also use your accounts to send spam or malware to your friends and family.</p>\n\n<h2>Managing Your Passwords</h2>\n\n<p>Once you have created strong passwords, you need to manage them securely. Here are a few tips for managing your passwords:</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Use a password manager.</strong> A password manager is a software program that stores and manages your passwords for you. This can help to keep your passwords safe and organized.</li>\n    <li><strong>Don't write down your passwords.</strong> If you write down your passwords, they could be stolen or lost. Instead, use a password manager or memorize your passwords.</li>\n    <li><strong>Be careful about who you share your passwords with.</strong> Only share your passwords with people you trust. If you share your passwords with someone, make sure they are aware of the importance of keeping them safe.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Password security is essential for protecting your online accounts from being hacked. By following the tips in this article, you can create strong passwords and manage them securely.</p>",

We use them to access everything from our email accounts to our bank accounts. However, many people do not realize the importance of creating and managing strong passwords. As a result, their accounts are often vulnerable to attack.</p>\n\n<h2>Overview of Password Security</h2>\n\n<p>Password security is the practice of creating and managing passwords in a way that makes them difficult to guess or crack. This involves using a variety of techniques, such as:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Creating strong passwords</strong>: Strong passwords are long, complex, and contain a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. They should also be easy to remember but difficult for others to guess.</li>\n<li><strong>Storing passwords securely</strong>: Passwords should be stored in a secure location, such as a password manager. This will help to protect them from being stolen or hacked.</li>\n<li><strong>Using two-factor authentication</strong>: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring you to enter a code from your phone or email in addition to your password. This makes it much more difficult for attackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Importance of Strong Passwords</h2>\n\n<p>Using strong passwords is one of the most important things you can do to protect your online accounts. A strong password will help to prevent attackers from guessing your password or cracking it using a brute force attack.</p>\n\n<p>Brute force attacks are a type of attack in which attackers try to guess your password by repeatedly trying different combinations of characters. The longer and more complex your password is, the more difficult it will be for attackers to guess.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, using a different password for each of your accounts will help to prevent attackers from gaining access to multiple accounts if they compromise one of your passwords.<p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Password security is essential for protecting your online accounts. By following the tips in this article, you can create and manage strong passwords that will help to keep your accounts safe from attack.</p>"

            "beginner": "<p>Passwords are the keys to your digital castle. Just like your housekeys, you want to do everything you can to keep your passwords safe.</p>\n<p>Passwords can be made ironclad with additional authentication methods, such as multifactor authentication (MFA).</p>\n<p>Creating, storing and remembering passwords can be a pain for all of us online, but the truth is that passwords are your first line of defense against cybercriminals and data breaches. Also, it has never been easier to maintain your passwords with free, simple-to-use password managers. With a few moments of forethought today, you can stay safe online for years to come.</p>\n<h2>LONG, UNIQUE, COMPLEX</h2>\n<p>No matter what accounts they protect, all passwords should be created with these three guiding principles in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><strong>Long</strong> \u2013 Every one of your passwords should be at least 12 characters long.</li>\n    <li><strong>Unique</strong> \u2013 Each account needs to be protected with its own unique password. Never reuse passwords. This way, if one of your accounts is compromised, your other accounts remain secured. We\u2019re talking really unique, not just changing one character or adding a \u201c2\u201d at the end \u2013 to really trick up hackers, none of your passwords should look alike.</li>\n    <li><strong>Complex</strong> \u2013 Each unique password should be a combination of upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers and special characters (like >,!?). Again, remember each password should be at least 12 characters long. Some websites and apps will even let you include spaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>HOW OFTEN DO I CHANGE MY PASSWORD?</h3>\n<p>If your password is long, unique and complex, our recommendation is that you don\u2019t need to ever change it unless you become aware that an unauthorized person is accessing that account, or the password was compromised in a data breach.</p>\n<p>This recommendation is backed up by the latest guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. For many years, cybersecurity experts told us to change our passwords every few months. However, this constant change isn\u2019t helpful if your passwords are each long, unique and complex. In fact, if you change your passwords often, you risk reusing old passwords or falling into bad habits of creating similar or weak passwords.</p>\n<p>BUT REMEMBERING ALL MY PASSWORDS IS SO HARD!?</p>\n<p>You probably have a lot of online accounts. And because all your passwords should be unique, that means you have a lot of passwords. But the fact remains that using long, unique and complex passwords remains the best way to keep all of your digital accounts safe. There are many free and easy-to-use tools out today that makes managing your library of unique passwords a snap.</p>\n<p>Today, the truth is that you don\u2019t have to remember your passwords. If you use the latest tools, you don\u2019t need to rack your brain at every login screen. You just need to remember the one password that unlocks your password manager vault.</p>\n<p>DON\u2019T TAKE A PASS ON PASSWORD MANAGERS.</p>\n<p>As our lives expand while we do more online, we\u2019ve gone from having just a couple of passwords to today, where we might manage upwards of 100 or more. If you\u2019re like most people, you\u2019re probably using the same password for most of your accounts\u2014and that\u2019s not safe. If your one password gets stolen because of a breach, it can be used it to gain access to all your accounts and your sensitive information.

            "beginner": "<h1>How to Create Strong Passwords</h1>\n\n<p>In this digital age, we rely on passwords to access countless accounts and services online. However, many people reuse the same weak passwords across multiple accounts, making them vulnerable to hacking and data breaches. Creating strong passwords is crucial for safeguarding your online presence. Here are some essential tips for creating passwords that are both secure and memorable:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Length: Aim for passwords that are at least 12 characters long. Longer passwords are harder to crack.</li>\n<li>Complexity: Use a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid common words or phrases that can be easily guessed.</li>\n<li>Uniqueness: Create different passwords for each account. Avoid reusing the same password for multiple accounts, as it increases the risk of all your accounts being compromised if one password is compromised.</li>\n<li>Avoid Personal Information: Don't use personal information, such as your name, birthday, or anniversary, in your passwords. This information is easily accessible to potential hackers.</li>\n<li>Use a Password Manager: Password managers store your passwords securely and automatically fill them in when you need them. This eliminates the need to remember multiple passwords and reduces the risk of using weak or reused passwords.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Password Managers</h2>\n\n<p>Password managers are essential tools for managing your online passwords. They store all your passwords in an encrypted vault, allowing you to access them with a single master password. This eliminates the need to remember multiple passwords and reduces the risk of using weak or reused passwords.</p>\n\n<h3>Features to Look for in a Password Manager:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Strong Encryption: Ensure that the password manager uses strong encryption algorithms to protect your passwords from unauthorized access.</li>\n<li>Multi-Factor Authentication: Opt for password managers that support multi-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security to your account.</li>\n<li>Cross-Device Sync: Choose password managers that allow you to sync your passwords across all your devices for easy access.</li>\n<li>Password Generator: Look for password managers that offer a built-in password generator to create strong and unique passwords for each account.</li>\n<li>Cloud-Based or Local Storage: Decide whether you prefer your passwords to be stored in the cloud or locally on your device.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Store Passwords</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to using a password manager, there are other ways to store your passwords securely:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Password Vault: Use a password vault, which is a secure file or software application that stores your passwords in an encrypted format.</li>\n<li>Encrypted USB Drive: Create an encrypted USB drive and store your passwords on it.</li>\n<li>Paper and Pen: Write down your passwords on a piece of paper and store it in a secure location.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Tips for Storing Passwords Securely:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't Share Passwords: Never share your passwords with anyone, even if they are close friends or family.</li>\n<li>Change Passwords Regularly: Regularly change your passwords for important accounts, such as email and banking.</li>\n<li>Review and Audit Your Passwords: Periodically review your passwords and remove any accounts you no longer use.</li>\n<li>Use Two-Factor Authentication: Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible to add an extra layer of security to your accounts.</li>\n<li>Keep Your Software Updated: Regularly update your operating system and software to install the latest security patches..</li>\n</ul>",
            "expert": "<h1>How to Create Strong Passwords</h1>\n\n<p>According to a recent study, people reuse the same password for 10 different accounts on average. This is a major security risk, as it means that if one of your passwords is compromised, all of your other accounts are at risk as well.</p>\n\n<h2>Creating Strong Passwords</h2>\n\n<p>Creating strong passwords is essential for protecting your online security. Here are some tips for creating strong passwords:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Use a minimum of 12 characters. The longer your password, the harder it will be to crack.</li>\n  <li>Use a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. This makes your password more difficult to guess.</li>\n  <li>Avoid using common words or phrases. Hackers can easily guess passwords that are based on common words or phrases.</li>\n  <li>Don't use the same password for multiple accounts. If one of your accounts is compromised, all of your other accounts are at risk.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Password Manager</h2>\n\n<p>A password manager is a software program that helps you to create, store, and manage your passwords. Password managers can help you to keep track of your passwords, and they can also help you to create strong passwords.</p>\n\n<p>There are many different password managers available, so it's important to choose one that is right for you. Here are some of the most popular password managers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>LastPass</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>1Password</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Dashlane</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>KeePass</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How to Store Passwords</h2>\n\n<p>Once you have created strong passwords, it's important to store them securely. Here are some tips for storing passwords securely:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Don't write down your passwords. If you write down your passwords, they could be stolen or lost.</li>\n  <li>Don't store your passwords in a text file. Text files are not secure, and they can be easily hacked.</li>\n  <li>Use a password manager. Password managers are the most secure way to store your passwords.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By following these tips, you can create strong passwords and store them securely. This will help to protect your online security.</p>",
            "intermediate": "<h1>How to Create Strong Passwords</h1>\n\n<h2>Length</h2>\n\n<p>The most important factor in creating a strong password is its length. The longer the password, the more difficult it will be to crack. A minimum of 12 characters is recommended, but longer is better.</p>\n\n<h2>Complexity</h2>\n\n<p>Another important factor is complexity. A password should be a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using common words or phrases, as these are easily guessed.</p>\n\n<h2>Uniqueness</h2>\n\n<p>Each password should be unique. Do not reuse passwords across multiple accounts. This makes it easier for attackers to gain access to all of your accounts if one of them is compromised.</p>\n\n<h2>Avoid Personal Information</h2>\n\n<p>Do not use personal information, such as your name, birthday, or address, in your passwords.

It's still important to remember:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Using a password manager creates a single point of failure.</li>\n    <li>Password managers are an obvious target for adversaries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is why you should have a strong master password and enable two-factor authentication when possible. But if a powerful adversary like a government is targeting you, it\u2019s important to carefully choose the right password manager and set it up for maximum security.</p>\n<p>For some people, a low-tech solution might be better than a password manager. It depends on your threat model, but having different passwords for each site written on a piece of paper and kept in a secure location is better than reusing a single password on every site.</p>\n<h2>Creating Strong Passwords Using Dice</h2>\n<p>You should memorize a few passwords that need to be particularly strong. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Passwords for your device</li>\n    <li>Passwords for encryption (like full-disk encryption)</li>\n    <li>The master password, or \u201cpassphrase,\u201d for your password manager</li>\n    <li>Your email password</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of many difficulties when people choose passwords themselves is that people aren't very good at making random, unpredictable choices. An effective way of creating a strong and memorable password is to use dice and a word list to randomly choose words. Together, these words form your \u201cpassphrase.\u201d A \"passphrase\" is a type of password that is longer for added security. For disk encryption and your password manager, we recommend selecting a minimum of six words.</p>\n<p>Why use a minimum of six words? Why use dice to pick words in a phrase randomly? The longer and more random the password, the harder it is for both computers and humans to guess. To find out why you need such a long, hard-to-guess password, here\u2019s a video explainer.</p>\n<p>Password managers make strong passphrases for you, but if you want to try an analog version to learn how it works, you can use one of EFF's standard word lists, or a fandom-inspired word list.</p>\n<p>If your computer or device gets compromised and spyware is installed, the spyware can watch you type your master password and could steal the contents of the password manager. So it's still very important to keep your computer and other devices clean of malware when using a password manager.</p>\n<h2>A Word About \u201cSecurity Questions\u201d</h2>\n<p>Be careful with the \u201csecurity questions\u201d that some websites use to confirm your identity. Honest answers to these questions are often publicly discoverable facts that a determined adversary can easily find and use to bypass your password entirely.</p>\n<p>Instead, give fictional answers that no one knows but you. For example, if the security question asks:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was the name of your first pet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Your answer could be a random password generated from your password manager. You can also store these fictional answers in your password manager.</p>\n<p>Think of sites where you\u2019ve used security questions and consider changing your responses. Do not use the same passwords or security question answers for multiple accounts on different websites or services.</p>\n<h2>Multi-Factor Authentication and One-Time Passwords</h2>\n<p>Strong, unique passwords make your account security much stronger. To further protect your accounts, enable two-factor authentication when you can.</p>\n<p>Some services offer two-factor authentication (also called 2FA, multi-factor authentication, or two-step verification), which requires you to possess two components (a password and a second factor) to gain access to your account. The second factor could be a one-off secret code or a number generated by an app running on a mobile device.</p>\n<p>Two-factor authentication using a mobile phone can be done in one of two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Your phone can run an authenticator application that generates security codes (most password managers can do this, or you can use a standalone application such as Authy), or you can use a stand-alone hardware device (such as a YubiKey).</li>\n    <li>The service can send you an SMS text message or email with an extra security code that you need to type in whenever you log in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you have a choice, pick the authenticator application or stand-alone hardware device instead of receiving codes by text message. It\u2019s easier for an attacker to redirect these codes to their own phone than it is to bypass the authenticator.</p>\n<p>Some services, such as Google, also generate a list of one-time passwords, sometimes called single-use passwords. These are meant to be printed or written down on paper and carried with you. Each of these passwords works only once, so if one is stolen by spyware when you enter it, the thief won't be able to use it for anything in the future.</p>\n<p>More useful than one-time passwords are backups of the security codes. Many authenticator applications offer optional backups, where your security codes are stored on a third-party server. This makes it so that if you lose your phone, you can restore the backup and easily get back into your accounts without finding those one-time passwords.</p>\n<p>If you don't have a backup, and you didn't save the one-time passwords, you may lose access to your accounts forever. Like password managers, this has a security trade-off and some people may not want to back up the tokens. Check with the app's documentation to make sure the backups are end-to-end encrypted. If you are never asked to create a password for the backup, there's a good chance they are not.</p>\n<h2>Sometimes, You May Need to Disclose Your Password</h2>\n<p>Laws about revealing passwords differ from place to place. In some jurisdictions, you may be able to legally challenge a demand for your password, while in others, local laws allow the government to demand disclosure, and even imprison you on the suspicion that you may know a password or key. Threats of physical harm can be used to force someone to give up their password. Or you may find yourself in a situation, such as traveling across a border, where the authorities can delay you or seize your devices if you refuse to give up a password or unlock your device.</p>\n<p>We have a separate guide to crossing the U.S. border that gives advice on how to deal with requests for access to devices while traveling to or from the United States. In other situations, you should think about how someone might force you or others to give up your passwords, and what the consequences would be.</p>",

It\u2019s easier for an attacker to redirect these codes to their own phone than it is to bypass the authenticator.</p>\n<p>Some services, such as Google, also generate a list of one-time passwords, sometimes called single-use passwords.

Like password managers, this has a security trade-off and some people may not want to back up the tokens. Check with the app's documentation to make sure the backups are end-to-end encrypted.

            "intermediate": "<h2>Creating Strong Passwords Using Password Managers</h2>\n<p>A password manager is a tool that creates and stores unique passwords for you, so you can use many different passwords on different sites and services without having to memorize them. Password managers:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Generate strong passwords that a human being would be unlikely to guess.</li>\n    <li>Store several passwords (and responses to security questions) safely.</li>\n    <li>Protect your passwords with a single master password (or passphrase).</li>\n    <li>Sync passwords between your devices, so you can access these complex passwords from anywhere.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Choosing the right password manager can take some research, but you can follow our guide to help ease the process.</p>\n<p>Passwords managers may not be for everyone, but a good password manager does its best to mitigate potential security problems. It's still important to remember:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Using a password manager creates a single point of failure.</li>\n    <li>Password managers are an obvious target for adversaries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is why you should have a strong master password and enable two-factor authentication when possible. But if a powerful adversary like a government is targeting you, it\u2019s important to carefully choose the right password manager and set it up for maximum security.</p>\n<p>For some people, a low-tech solution might be better than a password manager. It depends on your threat model, but having different passwords for each site written on a piece of paper and kept in a secure location is better than reusing a single password on every site.</p>\n<h2>Creating Strong Passwords Using Dice</h2>\n<p>You should memorize a few passwords that need to be particularly strong. These include:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Passwords for your device</li>\n    <li>Passwords for encryption (like full-disk encryption)</li>\n    <li>The master password, or \u201cpassphrase,\u201d for your password manager</li>\n    <li>Your email password</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of many difficulties when people choose passwords themselves is that people aren't very good at making random, unpredictable choices. An effective way of creating a strong and memorable password is to use dice and a word list to randomly choose words. Together, these words form your \u201cpassphrase.\u201d A \"passphrase\" is a type of password that is longer for added security. For disk encryption and your password manager, we recommend selecting a minimum of six words.</p>\n<p>Why use a minimum of six words? Why use dice to pick words in a phrase randomly? The longer and more random the password, the harder it is for both computers and humans to guess. To find out why you need such a long, hard-to-guess password, here\u2019s a video explainer.</p>\n<p>Password managers make strong passphrases for you, but if you want to try an analog version to learn how it works, you can use one of EFF's standard word lists, or a fandom-inspired word list.</p>\n<p>If your computer or device gets compromised and spyware is installed, the spyware can watch you type your master password and could steal the contents of the password manager. So it's still very important to keep your computer and other devices clean of malware when using a password manager.</p>\n<h2>A Word About \u201cSecurity Questions\u201d</h2>\n<p>Be careful with the \u201csecurity questions\u201d that some websites use to confirm your identity. Honest answers to these questions are often publicly discoverable facts that a determined adversary can easily find and use to bypass your password entirely.</p>\n<p>Instead, give fictional answers that no one knows but you. For example, if the security question asks:</p>\n<p>\u201cWhat was the name of your first pet?\u201d</p>\n<p>Your answer could be a random password generated from your password manager. You can also store these fictional answers in your password manager.</p>\n<p>Think of sites where you\u2019ve used security questions and consider changing your responses. Do not use the same passwords or security question answers for multiple accounts on different websites or services.</p>\n<h2>Multi-Factor Authentication and One-Time Passwords</h2>\n<p>Strong, unique passwords make your account security much stronger. To further protect your accounts, enable two-factor authentication when you can.</p>\n<p>Some services offer two-factor authentication (also called 2FA, multi-factor authentication, or two-step verification), which requires you to possess two components (a password and a second factor) to gain access to your account.

            "expert": "<h1>Best Practices for Avoiding Identity Theft Online</h1>\n\n<p>Identity theft is a serious problem that can have a devastating impact on your life. Thieves can use your stolen information to open new credit accounts, make fraudulent purchases, or even file taxes in your name. Taking steps to protect your identity online is essential to safeguarding your personal and financial information.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some best practices for avoiding identity theft online:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use strong passwords and change them regularly.</strong> Your passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using common words or phrases that can be easily guessed.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Never share your personal information online.</strong> This includes your Social Security number, credit card number, bank account number, or any other sensitive information.

            "intermediate": "<h1>Best Practices for Online Identity Protection</h1>\n\n<p>As an intermediate level reader, you likely have a basic understanding of cybersecurity and identity theft. This article will provide a more in-depth look at best practices for protecting your personal information online.</p>\n\n<h2>Regularly Monitor Your Accounts</h2>\n\n<p>One of the most important things you can do to protect your identity is to keep a close eye on your online accounts. This includes checking for suspicious activity, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Unauthorized logins</li>\n<li>Changes to your personal information</li>\n<li>Unusual transactions</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you notice any suspicious activity, take immediate action to secure your account and protect your information.</p>\n\n<h2>Avoid Public Wi-Fi Networks</h2>\n\n<p>Public Wi-Fi networks are notoriously insecure. This is because anyone can connect to these networks, including malicious actors. When you connect to a public Wi-Fi network, do not access sensitive information, such as your online banking or email accounts.</p>\n\n<h2>Use Strong Passwords</h2>\n\n<p>Strong passwords are an essential line of defense against identity theft. Make sure your passwords are at least 12 characters long and include a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using common words or phrases that can be easily guessed.</p>\n\n<h2>Enable Two-Factor Authentication</h2>\n\n<p>Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. When you enable 2FA, you will be prompted to enter a second factor, such as a code sent to your phone, when you log in to your account. This makes it much harder for identity thieves to access your accounts, even if they have your password.</p>\n\n<h2>Shred Sensitive Documents</h2>\n\n<p>Even in the digital age, it is important to shred sensitive documents before discarding them. This includes documents that contain your personal information, such as your Social Security number, credit card numbers, and bank account information.</p>\n\n<h2>Be Wary of Phishing Scams</h2>\n\n<p>Phishing scams are emails or text messages that appear to come from legitimate companies or organizations. These emails often contain links to malicious websites that can steal your personal information. Be wary of any emails or text messages that ask for your personal information. If you are unsure whether an email is legitimate, do not click on any links or open any attachments.</p>\n\n<h2>Educate Yourself</h2>\n\n<p>The best way to protect your identity online is to educate yourself about the latest cybersecurity threats. Stay informed about new scams and phishing techniques. The more you know, the better equipped you will be to protect yourself from identity theft.</p>\n\n<h2>How to Stay Secure Online</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to the best practices listed above, there are a number of other things you can do to stay secure online. These include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use a VPN (virtual private network) to encrypt your internet traffic and protect your privacy.</li>\n<li>Keep your software and apps up to date. Software updates often include security patches that can help protect you from vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li>Use a firewall to protect your computer from unauthorized access.</li>\n<li>Back up your data regularly. In the event of a data breach or other cyberattack, you will be able to recover your data from your backup.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Low Level Understanding of Identity Theft</h2>\n\n<p>Identity theft is a crime in which someone steals your personal information and uses it to commit fraud or other crimes. Identity thieves can use your personal information to:\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Open new credit card accounts in your name</li>\n<li>File fraudulent tax returns</li>\n<li>Get medical services in your name</li>\n<li>Take over your existing accounts</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Identity theft can have a devastating impact on your financial and emotional well-being. It is important to take steps to protect your personal information and stay safe online.</p>"
